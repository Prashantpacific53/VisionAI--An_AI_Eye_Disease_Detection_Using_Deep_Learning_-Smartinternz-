AI-ML Assignment 1: Use Case Analysis

Use Case:
# AI-Powered Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy
**Author:** Prashant Kumar

# 🌍 Why This Matters?
Imagine a world where no one loses their eyesight due to diabetes. **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** is a serious eye condition that can lead to blindness if not detected early. The problem? Many people don’t realize they have it until it’s too late, and regular eye screenings are expensive and time-consuming.

# But what if AI could help detect it faster, cheaper, and more accurately?

# 🔍 Understanding the Data
To build an AI system that detects Diabetic Retinopathy, we need a large dataset of retinal images. These images can be collected from:

Dataset Link:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunavenkatdoddi/eye-diseases-%20%20classification/data

✅ **Kaggle & UCI Machine Learning Repository** (Medical datasets)

✅ **Hospitals & Research Centers** (Real-world patient records)

✅ **Google Open Images** (Publicly available retinal images)

# ⚠️ Challenges with the Data
- **Some images are blurry or unclear** → AI needs preprocessing to enhance them.

- **Unbalanced dataset** → Very few severe cases compared to mild ones.

- **Different image qualities** → Cameras used in hospitals vary, affecting consistency.

🗂 Types of Data Involved

🔹 **Structured Data:** Patient details like age, medical history, test results.

🔹 **Unstructured Data:** High-resolution retinal images in .jpg or .png.

🔹 **Semi-Structured Data:** JSON/XML records with patient and diagnosis info.

# 💡 The Problem We Are Solving
__Current Challenge:__

Right now, diagnosing DR requires **trained eye specialists** who manually examine eye scans. This process is **slow, expensive, and not scalable especially** in rural areas where medical facilities are limited.

__Our Goal:__

Develop an AI-powered system that can **scan retinal images and detect early signs of Diabetic Retinopathy** with high accuracy.

# 🚀 How AI Can Solve This?

1️⃣ **Train a Deep Learning Model** using retinal images.

2️⃣ **Preprocess the images** → Enhance clarity and normalize them for consistency.

3️⃣ **Use CNN-based architectures** like **EfficientNet** or **ResNet** for accurate classification.

4️⃣ **Evaluate the model** on real-world patient data to measure performance.

5️⃣ **Deploy the AI system** in hospitals and mobile apps for instant DR screening.

# 🌟 The Impact
✅ **Early detection of blindness risks** → More lives saved.

✅ **Affordable eye checkups using AI** → Making healthcare more accessible.

✅ **Faster screenings** → Doctors can focus on treatment, not just diagnosis.

🔹 With AI, we **can help millions of diabetic patients protect their vision.**
