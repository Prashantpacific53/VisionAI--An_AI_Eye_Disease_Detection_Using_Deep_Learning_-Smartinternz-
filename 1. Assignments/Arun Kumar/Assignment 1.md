## 1. Data: Data Sources, Data Issues, Types of Data

### Data Sources:
Credit risk modeling in banking relies on various data sources to assess the risk associated with lending money. Key data sources include:

- **Internal Bank Data:**
  - **Customer Transaction Data:** Information on account transactions, payment histories, and balances.
  - **Loan Data:** Data about past loans, amounts, repayment schedules, and defaults.
  - **Credit Score Data:** Internal credit scoring systems to evaluate creditworthiness.
  - **Demographic Data:** Customer attributes such as age, income, and employment status.
  
- **External Data Sources:**
  - **Credit Bureau Data:** External credit reports and scores from bureaus like Equifax, TransUnion, or Experian.
  - **Macroeconomic Data:** Economic indicators like interest rates, inflation, unemployment rates, and GDP growth.
  - **Industry Data:** For corporate clients, industry-specific data such as revenue trends and market conditions.
  - **Public Records and Social Media Data:** Alternative data sources such as bankruptcy records or social media activity.

### Data Issues:
Data issues can affect the accuracy of credit risk models. Some common data issues are:

- **Missing Data:** Some attributes like income or loan performance may be missing.
- **Data Imbalance:** Non-defaulters usually outnumber defaulters, causing class imbalance.
- **Data Quality:** Errors or outdated data from external sources.
- **Data Privacy and Security:** Compliance with regulations like GDPR is critical.
- **Bias and Fairness Issues:** Bias related to gender, race, or socioeconomic status can affect model fairness.

### Types of Data:
Credit risk models use different types of data:

- **Structured Data:** Numerical and categorical data such as income, loan amounts, and repayment history.
- **Unstructured Data:** Text, emails, or social media posts that may require advanced techniques like NLP.
- **Semi-Structured Data:** Data with some organization but not in a traditional database format (e.g., JSON, XML).
- **Time-Series Data:** Financial data with a time component, such as transaction histories and interest rates.

## 2. Problem Statement in Credit Risk Modeling

### Problem Statement 1: Predicting Default Risk
The primary objective of credit risk modeling is to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. This is framed as a classification problem where the model predicts if a borrower is **high risk** or **low risk** based on their credit history, financial data, and other features.

**Example:**  
"Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a personal loan within 12 months, using transaction history, credit score, and demographic factors."

### Problem Statement 2: Credit Scoring
Credit scoring models aim to assign a credit score to a borrower, which indicates the likelihood of default. These models are used to categorize borrowers into different risk categories and guide lending decisions.

**Example:**  
"Create a predictive model for calculating a credit score for personal loan applicants, based on their credit history, income level, and other personal attributes."

## 3. Conclusion
Credit risk modeling is a crucial process in banking that helps assess and manage the risks of lending. A clear understanding of **data sources**, **data issues**, and **data types** is essential for building accurate models. The **problem statement** defines the objectives of the model, which might include predicting default risk, calculating credit scores, or managing portfolio risks.
